Testing rails.js:
- add confirmation message specs for inputs, not just links
- add tests around custom "confirm" event handlers for links & inputs

Jasmine:
- why is it ignoring an empty value for src_dir in the jasmine.yml?
	- we'd like to have a vendor/jquery.js file and cannot
	
Rails:
- go through ActionPack helpers to find unobtrusive JavaScript hooks
	- form_helper
	- form_tag_helper
	- url_helper
	- any other helpers?
